Snag Films
=====================

A minimal and light movie list in ReactJS. Please note that originally the API was producing films that had playable videos and as such I built a modal window to play videos. Unfortunately it would seem the latest films served by the API don't have videos in the data that we can use. 

### Usage

Clone the repository

```
Install the dependencies and start the server.

```
npm/yarn install

npm/yarn start

open http://localhost:3000
```

### Static Files

You can store static files like images, fonts, etc in the `build` folder.

For example, if you copy a file called my_image.png into the build folder you can access it using `http://localhost:3000/build/my_image.png`.

### Linting

Includes React ESLint configuration

```
npm run lint
```
